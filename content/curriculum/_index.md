#### Introduction to STEM Pathways and Careers Overview
Introduction to STEM Pathways and Careers was developed for the Louisiana Department of Education in partnership with the Cain Center at LSU. The course is offered to middle school students at the seventh-grade level for high school credit and serves as a universal course elective for the STEM Pathways as well as JUMPSTART and PLTW. This year long project-based course explores the four main pathways of STEM education and possible careers in the fields of 1) Computational Thinking and Computer Science, 2) Pre-Engineering, 3) Digital Design and Emergent Media, and 4) Biomedical Sciences. This course is meant to expose students to these overarching concepts: 
- To expand awareness of various careers and occupational pathways related to STEM
- To stimulate understanding and utilization of metacognition processes such as the engineering design process, the scientific method, and computational thinking
- To understand Foundation Knowledge and Skills and how they apply to each cluster as well as to educational and career success
- To increase interest in the 4 core areas of STEM related to this class through project-based activities that are also standards based.
<br></br>

#### Course Objectives
By the end of this course, the successful student will be able to:
-	Understand how computational thinking applies to both humans and computers.
-	Know and explain how to use the four stages of computational thinking through projects and    activities students design and code.
- Accurately explain the Engineering Design Process and utilize the process in various engineering projects featuring Arduino, robots, and mousetrap cars.
- Identify career opportunities in various STEM fields.
- Understand the role of visual communication and its cultural implications in society.
- Utilize various forms of digital and emergent media to design their own products.
- Explore and solve medical problems using various testing parameters in the areas of forensics, comparative anatomy, ecology studies, biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics.
